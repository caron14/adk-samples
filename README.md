# ADK Sample Agents Repository

This repository provides a collection of sample AI agents and reference implementations for both Python and Java. It is designed to help developers understand, customize, and deploy various agent-based solutions using the Agent Development Kit (ADK). Each agent is organized as an independent project with its own documentation, code, and deployment resources. Common utilities and shared modules are also included for reuse and extension.

## Repository Structure

- `agents/`
  - Common agent-related code and utilities.
- `common/`
  - Shared utilities and setup scripts used across agents.
- Root files
  - `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `uv.lock`, etc. â€” project-wide configuration and documentation files.
